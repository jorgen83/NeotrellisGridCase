Neotrellis Grid Case

A 3d printable case for the Neotrellis 128 grid. The length of the case is exactly 25cm, so this should be just printable on a Prusa I3.

The case is untested as I currently do not own a 3d printer. 

Case has all standoffs required and I included some extra parts for rigidity. 
Important to note that the case requires the use of the USB micro breakout PCB to enable better connectivity (the breakout can be screwed to the case, the teensy can't).

I added a slide-in part to hold the teensy. In theory you slide it in at a slight angle then drop it behind the notch that will hold it securely in place. Thank you Teensy designer for not even including one hole for construction purposes!

Hardware required:

2 M2.5 * 3mm screws (for USB breakout)

8 M2 threaded inserts (to melt into top part)
8 M2 * 8mm screws (to screw the top to the bottom of the case)

8 M2.5 * 6 mm screws (for attaching the PCB to the bottom case)

1 Micro USB breakout PCB
Teeny 3.2
8 Neotrellis PCBs
8 4x4 push buttons

Construction notes:

0. Melt in the threaded inserts into the top case
1. Solder all the wires to the Teensy and the USB breakout
2. Slide in the Teensy in the cradle in the bottom case
3. Screw the USB breakout to the bottom case
4. Connect the 4 pin connector to the Neotrellis board
5. Lay the Neotrellis boards in the bottom case and screw them in using the 8 screws
6. Lay on the rubber buttons followed by the top case
7. Turn over and screw in the 8 screws to connect the bottom and top cases.
